-- add encryption to the journal [DONE, via rc4]
-- add snapshot support
-- write update cell code
-- add indexing support
-- add undo support (HINT: use snapshots)
-- add des3 encryption support [DONE]
-- use BlockBuf - data_ptr.c, fav.c, type.c & snap.c are not compatible yet.[DONE]
-- use DiffList write
-C use ChangeTracker [DONE, except in data.c]
-- use Locking - table locking is in use for now (in interface calls);
   remove interface-interface calls to avoid conflict between locks,
   block locking in map-call returns seems necessary, OR use
   in-handle-list-locking when you want to access to something outside the
   tables (the table-locking style implementation is recomended);
   all kind of lock entries MUST be placed in interface calls, but they can't!
   [Table-Locking is done]
   [handle-list locking is somewhat complicated!]
