+ a=a+1; re a; -> a = 0???
//+ Fix ((339.7/201.7)-1)
//+ save state won't save vars?!?!
//+ Fix T(99) BUG

+ Arrays are not working as expected!

//+ FOR ALL EXPRESSIONS {tokenize -> combine -> syntax -> prefix} - NOW - tokenize + combine + syntax -> prefix!
//  THERE is a final big change in code, tokenize post processing... see project daedalus.

+ Process On Type, tokenize when typing.

//+ an a[i]=(1,2,4,5,...) would be nice!
//+ try array(a[2][2]); set a[0][0] to a[0][1]; then a[1][1]: sum of all others...
+ add stack-image file support, i.e. take an image of calc-stack, inject it on load {

    normal:
    1. parse
    2. prefix
    3. run prefix

    stack-image:
    1. inject prefix stack-image.
    2. run prefix

}

+ finish xrecalc()

+ every TOK_BR_OPEN needs a TOK_ABR_OPEN beside?
+ array merge needed
//+ performance penalty in afill and recalc while working with a full 2d array
+ hist can't be zero sized!
+ the IF subsystem needs extensive checks ( say 0;label a;+1;if(ans==100000){return;} else {goto a;}; )
+ fork(a,"a:1;_ fails
// fork(a,"...");...; CRASH [long exp] //donno... conditional in Q
// label a;+1;if(ans==10){return;};goto a; //run twice
+ ever need a continue?
//+ in Q & sometimes in C: mode fin;1;2;3;mode prog or nr; => CRASH :(
+ every op on sess has to be in cursess, fix it in Q;
//+ in C: run where autoload does not exists, mode fin; 1; 2; => CRASH :D

//+ print all array members if i < 0 or j < 0, see show_results
//+ 0;label a;+1;if(ans==2500000){jump;};goto a; // forking fails!
//+ set decim to 0 and type 100!!!
//+ type some, switch from mode nodet to mode det to CRASH!
+ try forking, switching to that process, and exit!
+ burst interactive array input: a[] -> 1[ENTER] 2+3[ENTER] 0[ENTER] [ENTER] burst?
  or array walk?? interactive array control mode -> UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, SET, VIEW, LIST, STORE
  plus a grid view in gui [DONE]
+ lightweight definitions: -> name, value
+ array functions like average, count [DONE], ...
//+ need today() and dayno2date()
+ a tray icon + system wide hotkey could be cool!
+ a timer function?
